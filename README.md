# Lottery-in-Solidity
This proyect deploys a contract which simulates a Lottery. Any users through a web3 interface can join, sending ether to the address which will be stored in the contract
until the 'Owner' Address gives an end to the round, and so it will randomly select a winner and transfer the price to its address. 

Things to improve on: 
  Probability of being selected as winner is not based on the ammount of money invested in the Lottery Round. This creates incentives to 'bet' as few as possible with the
same benefits. Rules and incentives were not developed in depth

  Could make use of more automatization to start and end rounds

  Create a Lottery Interface/web with React
